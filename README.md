## Bookstore app
- The project is a simple bookstore app that helps users organize and manage the books they read.
- It was built using react and redux which uses an [API](https://bookstore-backends.herokuapp.com/books) to store the books built using ruby on rails which can be found [here](https://github.com/fatymahmed/bookstore-backend).
